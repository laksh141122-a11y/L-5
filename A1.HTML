            <h3>Sandwich day</h3>
            <p>The sandwich is believed to have been invented in the 18th century by John Montagu, who was known for his love of
            gambling. To avoid interrupting his card games, he requested that his meat be served between two slices of bread,
            allowing him to eat without using utensils. This practical solution quickly gained popularity, leading others to order
            their meals "the same as Sandwich," which eventually led to the term "sandwich" being coined</p>
